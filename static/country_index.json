High Corruption Risk.\n\nCorruption is a significant barrier to business in Afghanistan, affecting various sectors such as permitting, procurement, and taxation, with systemic issues reported at border crossings that hinder economic development. Despite some anti-corruption initiatives led by former President Ghani, including the establishment of the Anti-Corruption Justice Center, corruption remains pervasive, with reports of land disputes and officials engaging in corrupt practices without facing penalties. The dismissal of Paul Martin raises concerns about oversight and accountability in aid distribution, potentially exacerbating corruption risks.\n\nNatural resources: Specifically the mining sector in Afghanistan has a high corruption rate. The corruption in the Mes Aynak copper mine project is a notable example. This site, located near Kabul, is home to one of the largest untapped copper deposits in the world, valued at billions of dollars. Additionally, a 2019 article from Foreign Policy titled \"Afghanistan's Mineral Resources Are the Taliban's Cash Cow\" examines how the Taliban have exploited Afghanistan's mineral wealth to fund their operations.\n\nAgriculture and Housing Sector: Agricultural endeavors inside Afghanistan have often been funded by foreign aid money. Land disputes are often resolved through bribes rather than legal channels, leading to illegal land grabs and property fraud, mainly luxury housing.\n\nFinancial sector (Hawala networks): While essential for money transfers, some Hawala operators engage in illicit transactions, including money laundering and funding criminal activities.\n\n**FATF / AML**\n\nFATF Status: None.\n\nAfghanistan is not on the FATF's high-risk or increased monitoring list.\nEU High-Risk third country list: Yes.\nTerrorist and insurgent financing, money laundering, bulk cash smuggling, and other illicit activities that finance criminal activity continue to threaten Afghanistan’s security and development. Although the government hs enacted laws to combat these crimes, it faces significant challenges in implementing and enforcing existing laws and regulations.\n\nAfghanistan is on the EU Commission list of countries with strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT regimes. Afghanistan is however no longer on the FATF List of Countries that have been identified as having strategic AML deficiencies as it has established the legal and regulatory framework relating to AML/CFT.\n\nFollowing the Taliban takeover of the country in August 2021, loss of access to offshore assets and disruption to trade and financial linkages led to overwhelming economic hardship across the country.\n\n**Sanctions**\n\nRestrictive measures (arms export; asset freeze and prohibition to make funds available\n\nAnd restrictions on admission) with respect to the Taliban.\n\nEU Sanctions type: Restrictive measures with respect to the Taliban.\n\nAfghanistan's UN membership is currently deferred, and if reinstated, it must adhere to UN sanctions aimed at maintaining international peace and security. The UN Security Council has established 31 sanctions regimes since 1966, which include measures like economic sanctions and arms embargoes, with a focus on protecting the rights of those targeted.\n\nThe U.S. has extended its national emergency regarding Afghanistan and issued General License 20 to ensure that sanctions do not hinder humanitarian efforts. Various sanctions are also enforced by the EU and UK, including asset freezes and travel restrictions, while the use of Hawala banking remains a critical financial lifeline for many in Afghanistan.\n\nThe sanctions include\n\nArms export\nAsset freeze and prohibition to make funds available\nRestrictions on admission.\nNow the restrictive measures are also concerning ISIL (Da'esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities."

Patients often encounter demands for informal payments to access medical services, undermining trust and equitable access to care. However, this information dates from the end of 2023, so the situation might have improved since Albania has improved their CPI score.\n\nEducation: The education sector is also vulnerable, with 70% of respondents indicating corruption issues. Practices such as bribery for grades or admissions compromise the quality and integrity of education.\n\nTourism Industry: The rapid growth of mass tourism in Albania has led to concerns about corruption in the tourism sector. Reports suggest that the surge in tourism has been accompanied by challenges such as inadequate public institutions and issues related to corruption, which could undermine sustainable development in the industry.\n\nEnvironmental sector: In Sept 2023, a former Albanian environment minister was sentenced to prison terms. Although the case was related to bribery over a contract to build an incinerator, the convicted minister was responsible for environmental issues, increasing corruption risk for this sector.

However, the situation still remains that foreign investors must navigate a high-risk environment characterized by nepotism and a culture of impunity, particularly in the oil and mining sector.\n\nNatural resource sector: ‘Trafigura Bribery Conviction’, which shows corruption in the oil industry. Also the ‘Isabel dos Santos Sanctions’ case highlights corruption in oil firms. Additionally, corruption in Angola's mining sector, particularly in diamond extraction, has been a significant concern. However, to address these issues, Angola was admitted to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2022. Additionally, in November 2023, the EU and Angola signed a sustainable investment facilitation agreement.

Despite these efforts, civil society expresses dissatisfaction with the pace of reforms, and corruption continues to pose challenges for U.S. investment, particularly in sectors like justice and law enforcement.\n\nMining sector: In 2018, EVN Report discussed the persistence of corruption in Armenia's mining sector, noting that despite governmental changes, sufficient steps had not been taken to eradicate or curb corruption in this field. However, in 2024, the Heinrich Böll Foundation analyzed Armenia's new Mineral Sector Development Strategy, which could exacerbate existing corruption risks.\n\nMedia sector: The media landscape in Armenia faces challenges related to ownership transparency and editorial independence. Many media outlets are controlled by business tycoons or political figures, leading to biased reporting and suppression of negative coverage about influential individuals. The BTI 2024 Armenia Country Report highlights that, despite governmental efforts to reduce corruption, certain interventions have inadvertently favored established market players, disadvantaging newcomers. This dynamic can perpetuate corrupt practices within various sectors, including media, by maintaining entrenched interests and limiting competition.\n\nReal estate sector: A 2016 report by Policy Forum Armenia provides an in-depth analysis of corruption across various sectors, including real estate. The U.S. Department of State's 2024 Investment Climate Statement for Armenia points out that, despite efforts to attract investment, challenges persist due to weaknesses in the rule of law and a legacy of corruption.

While direct evidence of corruption within media organizations is limited, the environment fosters conditions where self-censorship and compromised reporting can occur.\n\nNatural resource sector: Specifically SOCAR, the state-owned oil and gas company, has had a lot of corruption controversies around it. In the 1990s, during the initial phases of foreign investment, there were reports of substantial payments made to secure stakes in SOCAR. Ahead of hosting COP29 in 2024, Azerbaijan faced scrutiny for promoting new fossil fuel deals. A covert investigation revealed discussions between a fake oil company and SOCAR officials about potential joint ventures, highlighting ongoing concerns about the influence of fossil fuel interests.\n\nReal estate sector: Azerbaijan's real estate market, particularly in the capital city of Baku, has been influenced by political instability and pervasive corruption. These factors have historically overshadowed economic development and affected the transparency of property transactions. Furthermore, Jahangir Hajiyev, former chairman of the International Bank of Azerbaijan, was convicted in 2016 for fraud and embezzlement.

Despite these efforts, challenges persist due to limited media freedom, restricted civil society space, and a lack of free speech, which hinder transparency and accountability. In May 2023, state-owned media reported a crackdown on a corruption network in Sancti Spíritus, involving local officials selling products at three times the state-mandated price. These instances highlight the ongoing struggle against corruption within the country's political and economic systems. \n\nSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): The Cuban government's recent anti-corruption campaign has targeted public officials who illicitly profited from close ties with private businesses. This crackdown has also extended to private entrepreneurs, with reports indicating that numerous business owners have been restricted from traveling abroad due to tax-related issues. The necessity for private businesses to obtain operational permissions from local authorities creates an environment susceptible to bribery and favoritism. \n\nImport and Export Businesses: The import-export sector is another area where corruption is prevalent. The state's monopoly over production and imports creates opportunities for bribery and influence trafficking. As noted by Lennier López, an adjunct professor at Miami Dade College, \"The State has the discretionary power to choose which businesses are approved... This creates an arbitrary and unfair incentive, and public officials are bribed to get permits.\" \n\nTourism and Hospitality sector: Corruption in Cuba's tourism sector manifests in various forms, particularly through informal employment practices and misallocation of resources. A notable example involves hotel maintenance supervisors who, bypassing official channels, personally compensate workers or utilize fictitious funds labeled as \"entertainment expenses.\" In December 2024, El País reported that despite severe economic challenges, including frequent blackouts and food shortages, the Cuban government allocated nearly 40% of its investments in 2024 to the tourism sector.

Although some measures exist to combat corruption, such as the establishment of the National Committee on the Prevention and Fight Against Corruption, these initiatives remain largely unoperational and insufficient to address the pervasive corrupt practices. \n\nForestry sector: The forestry sector in Equatorial Guinea has faced issues with illegal logging and corruption, where officials are bribed to overlook violations. \"The laws that should sustain the legal system in Equatorial Guinea are mere semantics because they almost never apply. The government does not abide by the international and regional legal order of which it is a part, much less to its national laws\". This example highlights corruption in the forestry sector by showing how laws are not enforced, allowing illegal activities to flourish and leading to environmental degradation. \n\nNatural resource sector: The oil and gas sector in Equatorial Guinea is notorious for corruption, with high-level officials often implicated in embezzlement and mismanagement of revenues. Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima, former Minister of Mines, Industry and Energy, used his powerful position to allegedly extort bribes from businessmen and siphon off millions of euros of state money from a construction project.  \n\nConstruction sector: The construction sector is also plagued by corruption, with contracts often awarded based on favoritism and bribes. \"Portuguese construction firm Armando Cunha is accused of paying more than 10 million euros to companies linked to Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima\". This example illustrates corruption in the construction sector by demonstrating how public contracts are manipulated for personal gain, undermining fair competition and transparency.\n\n**FATF / AML**\n\nFATF Status: None. \n\nEquatorial Guinea is not on the FATF’s high-risk or increased monitoring list. \nAs of March 2025, Equatorial Guinea is not on the FATF's \"blacklist\" or \"grey list.\" It is an active member of the Action Group against Money Laundering in Central Africa (GABAC), a FATF-style regional body.\n\nIn 2016, the FATF conducted a Mutual Evaluation of Equatorial Guinea's anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism measures. The country has since worked with international partners, including the IMF and World Bank, to improve its AML/CFT systems.\n\nAlthough not currently under FATF's enhanced monitoring, Equatorial Guinea must continue strengthening its AML/CFT framework to stay compliant with global standards."

The banking system and black market currency exchanges constitute the focus of this activity, which affects the operation of the entire financial sector in the country. There are strong indications that large amounts of money are being pumped into the financial system from outside or suspicious sources, some of which are transported across borders or through ports.  Border security is a severe challenge in Mauritania. Because only an estimated 12 percent of Mauritanian adults have bank accounts,  informal banking and financial systems remain vulnerable to exploitation which will increase the rate of money laundering."

The U.S. government passed the NICA Act (Nicaragua Investment Conditionality Act), which aimed to put pressure on the Nicaraguan government for its alleged human rights abuses and corruption. The US issued an Executive Order blocking property of certain persons contributing to the situation in Nicaragua in response to the political situation in that country. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has designated several Nicaraguan government officials, including high-ranking officials and members of the military, for their involvement in human rights abuses and undermining democracy. These designations have resulted in asset freezes and travel restrictions on the sanctioned individuals."

The Government of Mahamadou Issoufou has committed to actively address corruption and has made some progress in this regard. Despite high levels of corruption, surveys indicate trust in the government and its institutions. Nigerien anti-corruption legislation is weak. \nMining sector: The mining sector in Niger is highly susceptible to corruption due to weak regulatory frameworks, lack of transparency, and political interference. International mining companies have reported challenges related to governance and operational control, especially following political upheavals. \nIn 2024, French nuclear fuel company Orano reported that Nigerien military authorities withdrew its operating permit for the Somair uranium mine. This action led to a suspension of production and raised concerns about governance and transparency in the mining sector. ​\nEnergy sector:  The energy sector, encompassing both traditional and renewable energy sources, is prone to corruption due to opaque procurement processes, misallocation of resources, and lack of accountability in project implementation. \nTelecommunications sector: The telecommunications industry is susceptible to corruption through bribery for licenses, regulatory approvals, and market access. Political connections often play a significant role in business operations within this sector. \nConstruction sector: The construction sector faces corruption risks related to the awarding of contracts, land acquisition, and compliance with building regulations. Bribery and favoritism can influence project approvals and execution.\n\n**FATF / AML**\n\nFATF Status: None.\nNiger is not on the FATF's high-risk or increased monitoring list.\nWith porous borders and a large, under-governed territory, Niger provides an ideal transit point for various criminal organizations and terrorist groups.

Despite the establishment of various anti-corruption strategies and agencies, widespread perceptions of corruption among the public and foreign investors indicate that significant work remains to be done. \n\nReal Estate and Construction: Weak regulatory oversight, lack of transparency in property transactions, and potential political connections influencing real estate developments. Romanian prosecutors uncovered a massive fraud involving the real estate developer Nordis, alleging the embezzlement of approximately €195 million through a pyramid scheme. The company falsely advertised investments in luxury properties, deceiving investors and causing substantial financial losses \n\nAdvertising and Media: Lack of regulation in digital advertising, insufficient safeguards against foreign interference in national elections, and the use of advertising platforms for unethical political agendas. The Russian advertising agency AdNow was implicated in disseminating disinformation during Romania's presidential elections. Operating from Bulgaria, AdNow targeted Romanian voters with pro-Russian content supporting presidential candidate Călin Georgescu. This campaign raised concerns about foreign interference and the ethical boundaries of digital advertising.\n\nTechnology and Social Media: Lack of oversight on digital fundraising, loopholes in campaign finance laws, and improper use of social media for political gain. Romanian prosecutors conducted raids in Brașov related to the illicit funding of Călin Georgescu's presidential campaign. The investigation uncovered the use of criminally sourced funds for a significant TikTok campaign promoting Georgescu, who declared zero campaign spending. \n\nFinancial Services: Corruption in local administration, misuse of EU funds, and lack of financial transparency in public sector projects. In Buzău County (January 2025): Six individuals, including the former mayor of Beceni in Buzău County, and one company were indicted for fraud and corruption.

Apart from this, Romania has some of the highest rates of cybercrime and online credit card fraud in the world. Studies have found Romanian servers to be the second largest source of cybercrime transactions worldwide.

These measures were expanded in December 2013 to address the illegal removal of Syria's cultural heritage. In December 2014, additional sanctions targeted items used by the Assad regime's air force in indiscriminate attacks on civilians. Since 2014, the EU has continuously added individuals and entities to its sanctions list, primarily those responsible for the regime's violent repression, support for the Syrian regime, and involvement in chemical weapons production and attacks. The EU strategy on Syria, stated in 2017, emphasized continued sanctions on those supporting the regime. In February 2025, the EU decided to suspend some sanctions in energy, transport, and finance sectors to support Syria’s political transition, economic recovery, and reconstruction.

High Corruption Risk.\n\nUganda continues to face significant challenges, with endemic corruption hindering investment and business operations. Corruption constitutes a major challenge for businesses operating or planning to invest in Uganda. The police, the judiciary and procurement are areas where corruption risks are very high and under-the-table cash payments are expected.\n\nMining & Natural Resources: The mining sector experiences significant corruption related to licensing, illegal mining activities, and the mismanagement of resources, often creating an environment of unfair competition and environmental harm.\n\nFinancial Sector: In February 2025, eight officials from the Ministry of Finance were charged with corruption, electronic fraud, and money laundering following a hacking incident that led to the loss of at least $21 million from the central bank's systems.\n\nJudicial Sector: The judicial system in Uganda is considered highly susceptible to corruption, with political interference being a significant concern. Approximately one in six companies report that the court system is a major constraint to their business operations, and bribes for favorable judicial decisions are common.\n\nHealth Sector: Corruption within Uganda's health sector has been a persistent issue, with challenges including the misappropriation of funds and resources intended for healthcare services. Efforts to counteract these issues have involved integrated governance approaches to enhance transparency and accountability.\n\n Construction Sector: The construction industry in Uganda has faced challenges related to fraud and corruption, particularly in public procurement processes.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain, such as the ongoing issues of corruption and inefficiency that hinder foreign investment and fair competition. In Ukraine, several private sectors are vulnerable to corruption.\n\nAgricultural Sector: The agricultural sector in Ukraine is plagued by corruption, particularly due to a lack of transparency and the influence of political connections. In April 2024, Ukrainian Minister of Agriculture Mykola Solsky was arrested on suspicion of involvement in an illegal transaction for the acquisition of state-owned land worth €6.5 million.\n\nDefense Sector: Multiple cases have emerged where high-ranking officials from the Ministry of Defense were involved in embezzlement of funds. In January 2025, Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) launched an investigation into Defense Minister Rustem Umerov over allegations of abuse of power related to arms procurement. \n\nEnergy Sector: While specific recent cases are less documented in available sources, Ukraine’s energy sector remains susceptible to corruption, particularly due to the influence of politically connected businesses and a lack of transparency in major energy projects.\n\nConstruction Sector: The construction industry has been implicated in corruption scandals, with reports indicating that the economic regulatory system is highly corrupt, leading to the development of a large informal economy benefiting corrupt private sector actors\n\n**FATF / AML**\n\nFATF Status: None. \n\nTurkey is not on the FATF’s high-risk or increased monitoring list. \nCorruption enables and exacerbates the significant money laundering problem in Ukraine.

In response, on 23 February 2022, the EU adopted restrictive measures, prohibiting the import of goods from these areas (unless certified by the Ukrainian government), restricting trade and technology in certain sectors, and prohibiting services in transport, telecommunications, energy, oil, gas, mineral exploration, and tourism in these regions. On 21 September 2022, Russia escalated its aggression by supporting illegal \"referenda\" in parts of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. In response, the EU extended the restrictive measures on 6 October 2022 to cover all non-government controlled areas in these regions. Derogations and exemptions are allowed, including for humanitarian aid.\n\nThe sanctions include\n\nFinancial measures\nInvestments\nRestrictions on goods and services\nEU Sanctions type: Misappropriation of state funds of Ukraine.\n\nOn 20 February 2014, the Council of the EU condemned in the strongest terms all use of violence in Ukraine and called for an immediate end to the violence, and full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Council also called upon the Ukrainian Government to exercise maximum restraint and opposition leaders to distance themselves from those who resort to radical action, including violence. On 3 March 2014, the Council agreed to focus restrictive measures on the freezing and recovery of assets of persons identified as responsible for the misappropriation of Ukrainian State funds and persons responsible for human rights violations, with a view to consolidating and supporting the rule of law and respect for human rights in Ukraine.\n\nThe sanctions include\n\nAsset freeze and prohibition to make funds available\nEU Sanctions type: Restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.\n\nOn 17 March 2014, the EU imposed asset freezes and travel restrictions on individuals and entities responsible for actions undermining Ukraine's sovereignty, following Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity. This decision came after the EU condemned Russia's actions, including the illegal referendum in Crimea. The list of sanctioned individuals and entities has been expanded over time. On 22 February 2022, the EU condemned Russia's recognition of the non-government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent and the deployment of Russian troops.

Derogations, including for humanitarian aid, are allowed.\n\nThe sanctions include\n\nAsset freeze and prohibition to make funds available\nRestrictions on admission\nEU Sanctions type: Restrictive measures in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.\n\nOn 6 March 2014, EU leaders condemned Russia's violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. The European Council, on 20-21 March 2014, condemned Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and vowed not to recognize it, proposing economic, trade, and financial restrictions on Crimea. On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262, affirming Ukraine's sovereignty and rejecting the illegal Crimea referendum. On 23 June 2014, the EU imposed a ban on the import of goods from Crimea or Sevastopol, with exceptions for goods certified by Ukraine. Additional measures followed, restricting trade, investment, and services in key sectors like transport, telecommunications, energy, and tourism in Crimea. The European Council, on 19 March 2015, reaffirmed its non-recognition policy, and the restrictive measures were renewed on 17 June 2024, set to expire on 23 June 2025.
