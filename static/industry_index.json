Key risks include chargebacks from cardholders disputing transactions, the misuse of stolen credit card details in online purchases, and scam merchants engaging in bust-out fraud or deceptive marketing tactics, such as fake emails. Other typical fraud risks in this industry involve a lack of transparency in recurring subscriptions, whereby consumers sign up for free trials and forget to cancel their subscription before their cards are charged, and the danger of unauthorized individuals using stolen login credentials to commit fraudulent transactions or resell access. Additionally, in strip clubs, there is also the risk of fraudulent transactions occurring after drinks are spiked.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://risklink.uk/blog/fraud-protection-for-adult-entertainment-payments/ https://vendoservices.com/blog/best-practices-for-managing-payment-fraud-in-the-adult-digital-media-industry/ https://en.clear.sale/blog/industry-focus-fraud-risk-profile-for-adult-entertainment-retailers"

    "body": "Adult entertainment industry is considered a high corruption risk business because it acts as a fertile area for bribery to aid human trafficking and money laundering. Organised crime groups are documented as having high levels of involvement with regulated industries, including the sex industry and the adult entertainment venues. It is therefore likely that agencies that regulate these industries are attractive targets for organised crime groups, thus vulnerable for bribes and corruption. \nPolice corruption and sex trafficking have a complex link in many developing countries. The adult entertainment companies or the intermediaries might bribe police or officials to aid them in sex trafficking. Thus, this sector pose a threat to violation of human rights as well. For instance, in March 2024, UN Special Rapporteur Mama Fatima Singhateh reported to the Human Rights Council that sexual abuse and exploitation of children are widespread in the entertainment industry, including the adult sector. Her findings emphasized the urgent need for collective action to combat these abuses.\nHuman Rights Watch released a report detailing severe labor abuses in the adult web-camming industry, particularly in Colombia. The report highlighted deplorable working conditions, exploitation by studio owners, and lack of corporate accountability from major platforms. This highlights corporate negligence, bribery, regulatory capture and systemic exploitation, enabled by weak oversight.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://knowledge.everc.com/blog/mitigating-the-risks-associated-with-offering-adult-content  https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/04/city-regulator-fca-warns-banks-over-denying-sex-workers-business-accounts https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-whistleblower-says-mastercard-visa-failed-stop-payments-child-sex-abuse-2025-01-24/  https://instabill.com/articles/qualities-of-high-risk-merchant-accounts/why-are-adult-service-providers-called-high-risk-merchant-accounts/"

The Dutch case involves Dutch prosecutors saying in March 2019 they were evaluating signs of Dutch bank involvement in a money laundering network which allegedly channeled billions of euros from Russia. The Dutch prosecutors said ABN Amro reported suspicious transactions too late or not at all over a long period, adding it failed to properly investigate client behavior and did not sever ties with suspect clients in a timely fashion.\n2005 AML/sanctions issues: ABN Amro Bank paid a total of $80 million in fines for violating regulations to prevent money-laundering. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the Treasury Department said that ABN's \"serious, longstanding and systemic\" problems allowed people from Russia and other former Sovjet republics to move $3.2 billion to shell companies in the United States from August 2002 to September 2003. AAB paid record USD 500 mln fine in 2015 to US in Connection with Conspiracy to Defraud the United States and with Violation of the Bank Secrecy Act .\n2021 AML issues: In April 2021, ABN AMRO agreed to a €480 million settlement with Dutch prosecutors over allegations of serious shortcomings in its anti-money laundering practices. The settlement included a €300 million fine and €180 million in disgorgement. Subsequently, in December 2024, Dutch prosecutors dropped criminal cases against former executives of ABN AMRO, citing insufficient evidence. \tSettlement for AML investigations\n2019 Integrity issues: German authorities raid ABN Amro offices in Frankfurt for dividend stripping, known as cum-ex, typically involves cross-border trading of company shares around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, each of whom was entitled to a tax rebate. The office accused six people of causing tax damages worth a total of €53.3 million ($58.5 million)\n2024 Regulatory issues: In October 2024, the London Metal Exchange fined ABN AMRO Clearing Bank NV approximately $299,200 for inadequate risk management systems that failed to detect potential market abuse between January 2018 and November 2020.\nABN fined by LME\nMitigating factors:\nThe Kingdom of The Netherlands and the EU and has enacted laws and rules designed to implement the anti-money laundering policies of both FATF and the EU. ABN Amro Bank N.V. is supervised by the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets and De Nederlandsche Bank. Consequently, ABN Amro Bank N.V. is firmly committed to participating in international efforts to combat money laundering and the funding of terrorist and criminal activities.\nRegarding the AML issues in 2019: ABN AMRO is putting in a great effort to detect criminal transactions – that’s part of their role as a gatekeeper. ABN Amro bank N.V. wants their financial infrastructure to stay safe and reliable for theirbona fide clients. ABN Amro bank N.V. does not want to facilitate criminals, of course. Every day, over 3000 ABN AMRO employees screen new and existing clients (client due diligence) and/or monitor unusual transactions. ABN Amro Bank N.V. is using artificial intelligence and robotics to improve effectiveness and efficiency in making progress in bringing the client files in order and expect to complete this by 2022. ABN Amro Bank N.V. confirmed that it is in \"constant dialogue\" with regulator DNB.\nRegarding the Integrity issues: ABN Amro Bank N.V. has set up new mitigating projects since cum-ex to prevent new cases of dividend stripping. This has resulted in no new cases and frequently receives information requests from German authorities in relation to other investigations and fully cooperate.\nRegarding the AML issues in 2005: ABN Amro has reacted to the fine with intensive international KYC remediation project in 2006. The adverse media is mitigated because this is from almost 20 years ago and it referred to the former ABN Amro organisation, currently taken over by RBS. \nRegarding the 2024 regulatory issues: following the LME report, ABN has implemented a series of enhancement measures and management system control to guard against market abuse.\nDuring the screening for involvement in financial and economic crime from ABN Amro Bank N.V., many violations and risk triggers were identified. ABN AMRO has been charged with heft fines of worth 500 million euros in last 5 years for bribery/AML/fraud. The persistent allegations and bad press could cause substantial reputation damage to the ABN Amro Bank N.V.. The biggest ones since 2000 are listed below:\nit paid record USD 500 mln fine in 2015 to US in Connection with Conspiracy to Defraud the United States and with Violation of the Bank Secrecy Act\nDutch branch of ABN Amro bank NV paid EUR 4 mln fine in 2017 to NMa for rigging debit-card rates between 1998-2001\nUS branch of ABN Amro bank NV EUR 640.000 to UAE regulator from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014 for insufficiently monitoring bank accounts to implement appropriate safeguards to prevent opportunities for money laundering.\nABN Amro Bank NV is being investigated for money laundering in a new blow to shares in the Dutch bank, which prosecutors allege failed to report or probe suspicious transactions between 2004 and 2014. The fine against fellow Dutch bank ING in 2018 could be used as a reference point for any penalty ABN Amro Bank NV could face.\nThe adverse media screening indicates that most serious violations occurred in ABN Amro bank NV US business unit between 2007-2019 and most fines were imposed between 2015-2018 by US regulators. Recent Google search shows that ABN Amro is facing corruption allegation in Netherlands in 2019.

These extensive operations require huge swaths of land, as well as large supplies of energy and water. Theme parks have a variety of direct and indirect effects on the environment. They contribute to air pollution indirectly through the massive amounts of energy needed to keep the park running. Fossil fuels are burned to power rides and facilities, heat or cool buildings, and light the streetlamps that line the sidewalks and pathways of the park.\nMoreover, an attraction that draws in large crowds of people for extended periods, especially one with many concession stands, is bound to create and collect a lot of trash. Some of the trash can be recycled, but those materials still need to be sorted and taken to a recycling facility, increasing fossil fuel consumption. Trash that cannot be recycled typically ends up in a landfill, where it contributes to global warming by emitting methane, a greenhouse gas, as it decays.\nFurthermore, depending on the park's location, the environmental impact can be quite drastic. Most theme parks aren't built in urban areas where they replace existing buildings or asphalt lots. Instead, they are typically constructed in rural areas largely untouched by humans, requiring the clearing of trees, leveling of land, and overall transformation of the property. This transformation often leaves various species of birds and animals without a natural habitat.

It is one of the biggest contributors to global climate change and deforestation around the world, presenting a great threat to the world’s biodiversity.\nSome of the facts are astounding. For example, animal agriculture is responsible for emitting 18% of all greenhouse gases, and this is expected to increase by 80% by the year 2050. The production of one calorie of animal protein requires ten times more fossil fuels than it takes to produce one calorie of plant protein. Factory farming is responsible for much more destruction, including chemical fumes, toxic runoff, and unsustainable water use. The animal waste that runs off these livestock lots pollutes local waterways with pesticides, herbicides, hormones, antibiotics, phosphate-rich fertilizer, and bacteria. This waste reduces clean water availability around the world and diminishes the supply of uncontaminated fish.\nIn addition, the massive number of animals produced on small areas of land is unsustainable and leads to reduced soil fertility and desertification, a loss of plants, and the inability to regrow lost flora. Animal production is particularly blamed for increases in greenhouse gas emissions leading to global warming. The core concerns are methane emissions stemming from the ruminal fermentation of herbivore animals and, to a lesser extent, from animal excrement. These factors also degrade water surface quality by releasing phosphate residues, trace elements (copper, zinc), and nitrates into the water. \nYet the increase in the world population, expected to reach 11 billion by 2050 (compared to 7 billion in 2010), poses an even greater concern when combined with an expected increase in per capita meat consumption. This growth will likely exacerbate the environmental impacts of animal agriculture, making it imperative to consider sustainable alternatives.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.feedia-techna.com/en/productivity/experts/reduce-environmental-impact-livestock-productions#:~:text=Animal%20production%20is%20given%20particular%20blame%20for%20increases,and%2C%20to%20a%20lesser%20extent%2C%20from%20animal%20excrement. https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainability/articles/10.3389/frsus.2022.841106/full\n\n\nhttps://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/2022/03/15/it-may-be-uncomfortable-we-need-talk-about-it-animal-agriculture-industry-and-zero-waste\n\n\nhttps://www.worldatlas.com/articles/environmental-impact-of-animal-agriculture.html"

Bribery in the military aviation industry has indeed been exposed in recent years, such as the case with Embraer, which paid $205 million to settle Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) charges for bribing government officials in multiple countries (Embraer). Aviation products, services and activities are subject to a number of regulators such as by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and other regulatory bodies. The gaining of government permission can also expose the client to corruption. Furthermore, Aerospace and Defense companies often work in partnerships a number of small and non-consolidated entities. These entities have a lower level of control and oversight from their parent groups and presents higher risk of fraud and corruption.\nThe defence industry is a prime target for corruption because of the vast amount of money involved, global military expenditure in 2019 was estimated at more than $1.9 trillion (Expenditure). The close links between defence contracts and politics, and the notorious veil of secrecy under which the sector operates.\n\nThe impact of corruption in the arms trade is particularly serious. The value of defence contracts means that huge amounts of public money can be wasted, instead of being spent on essential services. Corruption perpetuates conflict and costs lives when troops are equipped with inadequate equipment and corrupt officials use gains from defence deals to strengthen their personal positions and undermine democracy.\nMore than 40 percent of all global corruption originates from the global arms trade. Poor, contradictory and weakly enforced governance systems have allowed for reporting between importing and exporting nations to become a largely private affair, devoid of meaningful scrutiny. Investigative journalism and whistleblowers have exposed many of these deals which would otherwise never have been known.\n\nArms deals are often concluded by politicians, military leaders, corporate executives and dubious intermediaries, all of whom benefit materially and politically from the transactions. Corruption is rife and often ignored, leading to inappropriate military matériel being purchased for the bribes rather than the security of the nation. The trade operates with virtual impunity behind a veil of national-security-imposed secrecy (Trump's tariffs threaten US weapon production).\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://globaljustice.yale.edu/news/exposing-corruption-global-arms-trade https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016-224#:~:text=The%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission,Corrupt%20Practices%20Act%20(FCPA).  https://www.statista.com/chart/3591/the-biggest-military-budgets-as-a-percentage-of-gdp/#:~:text=Military%20Spending&text=In%202019%2C%20total%20global%20military,percent%20higher%20than%20in%202010.  https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-defense-weapons-supply-chains-00006481 https://ti-defence.org/defence-companies-index-on-anti-corruption-and-corporate-transparency/  https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus?ind=D  https://fas.org/publication/defense-contracting-fraud/"

Yet potential bribery and corruption offenses are still the subject of investigations by the authorities. One topic that has gained growing attention is so-called quick savings. Quick savings – also known as nomination fees, or upfront payments – are by no means new to the automotive industry. In fact, it’s become a common phenomenon.Quick savings exist in many forms. Typically, an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) demands a one-off payment from a supplier. In return, the supplier is awarded a contract or qualified to tender or bid for a contract (so-called pay-to-play payment). There are also constellations in which the OEM demands so-called savings on current account from the supplier during a contract, to qualify for further contracts or biddings.\nDepending on the case and set-up, these payments could bear a potential corruption risk. This may lead to a potential (criminal) liability – for both the person acting for the company and the company itself.\nMoreover, the automobile industry is especially prone to corruption because of business practices that encourage suppliers to put up big money to win contracts from carmakers. Immense pressure on suppliers to cut costs or face losing contracts also compounds the potential for bribery and other illicit payments (Pressure to cut costs). For more than 10 years it has been common practice in contract negotiations for carmakers to demand entirely officially sums worth millions from suppliers just so they can make the short list for a contract or a follow-on contract.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://kaizen.com/insights/cost-reduction-automotive-industry/llion-euro-vat-fraud-involving-car-sales https://bac-2020.hoganlovellsabc.com/the-global-outlook/automotive-transportation  https://www.independent.ie/life/motoring/why-the-car-industry-is-prone-to-corruption/26376644.html"

The economic importance of being able to trade flowers quickly stands in the way of thorough checks, while the transports are attractive for drug smuggling.\nThis is evident from a study commissioned by several municipalities, flower auction Royal FloraHolland, and the trade association of flower traders.\nHowever, it is suspected that the flower trade is mainly used for the transit of drugs from the Netherlands to the rest of Europe. Cocaine, for example, that enters the country via the port of Rotterdam is transported by road to other countries. Just last summer, 400 kilos of cocaine and speed were intercepted in a truck full of flowers. “The massive daily flower transports are attractive to criminals wanting to transport drugs,” the report warns. Every year, over 6 billion euros worth of flowers are exported from the Netherlands. There are shuttle services to almost every place in Europe, and cargo is rarely inspected within the European Union.\nThe researchers also warn of other forms of crime. Transports are also used to smuggle weapons, cigarettes, and fireworks (Special flowers). Because a lot of cash circulates in the flower sector, there is a risk that criminals use flower trading as a cover to launder their crime money. In addition, according to the report, there is fraud involving invoices, VAT rates, and consignment notes (Fin police report). Illegal labor practices are also common, with employment agencies involved in labor exploitation.\nAccording to the report, the flower auction itself plays an important role in tackling crime. A large part of the trade takes place via the auctions of Royal FloraHolland, which connects 4,000 growers and 2,500 traders. Many traders have a small business on the grounds of one of the auctions. It is often unclear who is behind these small businesses. Traders are allowed to sublet their space at the auction. Moreover, the sites in Aalsmeer, Naaldwijk, and Rijnsburg are hardly secured and freely accessible, unlike, for example, the port or the airport.

    "body": "Gambling has always attracted individuals intent on processing the proceeds of crime, making it a prime target for money laundering. This industry is characterized by the rapid movement of large sums of money, creating ample opportunities for transforming illicit funds into untraceable, clean cash. The casino and gaming sector, in particular, is considered to have an extreme risk of money laundering due to the variety, frequency, and volume of transactions. Casinos are inherently cash-intensive businesses, with the majority of transactions being cash-based. During a single visit, a customer may engage in numerous cash or electronic transactions, whether at the \"buy-in\" stage, during play, or at the \"cash-out\" stage. This routine exchange of cash for casino chips, TITO tickets, and certified checks, along with electronic transactions to and from casino deposit accounts and other jurisdictions, makes casinos an attractive target for money laundering.\nOnline gambling also presents significant money laundering risks. The industry is characterized by vast sums of money moving quickly and often anonymously. Sports betting, in particular, offers opportunities for both generating illegal proceeds through game fixing and for pure money laundering purposes. Criminals can use the sports betting market to launder money obtained from illegal activities. By placing wagers with illicit funds, they can receive winnings as legitimate income. Additionally, the use of multiple accounts and the difficulty in tracking transactions make it challenging for financial institutions and law enforcement agencies to detect and prevent money laundering in online gambling.\nOther substantial challenges in the gambling sector include the presence of foreign exchange facilities, reduced transparency for high rollers in VIP rooms, and the use of foreign holding accounts. These factors contribute to the complexity and attractiveness of the sector for money laundering activities. For instance, foreign exchange facilities can be exploited to convert large amounts of cash into different currencies, making it harder to trace the origins of the funds. VIP rooms and high rollers often engage in large transactions that may not be scrutinized as closely, providing opportunities for illicit activities. Foreign holding accounts allow funds to be moved across jurisdictions, complicating the detection of money laundering activities.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://anti-money-laundering.eu/online-gambling-services/ https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/Vulnerabilitiesofcasinosandgamingsector.html https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/Vulnerabilitiesofcasinosandgamingsector.html\n\n\nhttps://stoppredatorygambling.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2013-Casinos-and-Political-Corruption-in-the-United-States.pdf#:~:text=The%20apparent%20link%20between%20casinos%20and%20corruption%20is\n\n\nhttps://nvbar.org/wp-content/uploads/13-Money-Laundering.pdf\n\n\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/online-gambling-sites-money-laundering-1.7087399\n\n\nhttps://www.sanctions.io/blog/money-laundering-in-the-gaming-and-gambling-industry"

    "body": "Casinos typically require licenses to operate, which can lead to instances of bribery as operators seek to obtain the necessary permits. The substantial permit fees and tax revenues generated by casinos, along with federal transfers, represent significant sums of money over which politicians and bureaucrats may have considerable discretion. This financial influence can create opportunities for political corruption. Recent examples include lobbying efforts in New York, where casino operators spent millions to influence decision-makers, and a corruption scandal in Indiana involving a legislator who accepted compensation from a gaming company in exchange for favorable legislative actions.\nIn online gambling, corruption linked to sports betting often involves teams or players who cheat to lose, enabling match fixing and rigged matches aimed at profiting from the betting market. The fierce competition between online betting sites results in increasingly attractive and complex betting modes, which can inspire strategies to corrupt sports. Criminal organizations may use sports betting to launder money gained through illegal activities. For instance, they might place bets with illicit funds and receive winnings as legitimate income. The global problem of illegal sports betting and its connection to organized crime was highlighted at a recent UN conference, emphasizing the need for improved regulations and data sharing.\nAdditionally, in some countries, licenses or permits are required for betting operators, which can lead to bribery as companies seek to obtain these permits. The case of Cantor Gaming, which repeatedly violated state and federal laws, underscores the risks associated with the online gambling industry (Cantor gaming). The presence of foreign exchange facilities, reduced transparency for high rollers in VIP rooms, and the use of foreign holding accounts further complicate the detection and prevention of corruption in both physical and online gambling sectors.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144857 https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/12/new-york-casino-corruption-00086415\n\n\nhttps://marketrealist.com/indiana-casion-corruption/\n\n\nhttps://www.gamblingnews.com/news/north-carolina-casino-project-implicated-in-corruption-scandal/"

    "body": "Casinos have been involved in various fraudulent activities, ranging from rigging slot machines to pay out less to more complex schemes like skimming money from a wide range of games. These activities result in the institution obtaining more money than the customer. Recent examples include Resorts World Las Vegas facing a $10.5 million fine for permitting gamblers tied to illegal bookmaking operations and individuals with federal felony convictions to play freely at the venue (Resorts Las Vegas). Additionally, scams targeting casinos have become more sophisticated, with fraudsters using AI-driven tactics to exploit unregulated offshore platforms.\nOnline gambling has also given rise to a new breed of tech-savvy fraudsters who are relentless in their pursuits to steal money. The industry has seen a significant increase in digital fraud, with promotion abuse being the most common type. Fraudsters exploit promotional offers and bonuses, often using synthetic identities created from data breaches. Money launderers also use online gambling sites to disguise illicit funds, taking advantage of multiple deposit and withdrawal methods to conceal the source of their money.\nThe mobile games market has become a magnet for fraudsters and their attacks. Scams like fake in-game purchases and phishing schemes are increasingly common, causing substantial financial losses. For instance, NetEase employees were recently arrested for their involvement in a multi-million-dollar fraud scheme. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has identified significant financial and privacy risks to consumers in video gaming marketplaces, highlighting the need for better protections against scams and theft.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.gamblingnews.com/news/transunion-report-exposes-soaring-digital-fraud-in-online-gambling-industry/ https://www.onlinebetting.org.uk/betting-guides/gambling-fraud.html\n\n\nhttps://www.casinos.com/news/battling-fraud-in-an-ai-driven-world-and-its-implications-for-the-casino-industry\n\n\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/online-gambling-sites-money-laundering-1.7087399\n\n\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/netease-employees-have-allegedly-laundered-up-to-usd139-3-million-in-a-trading-scheme-that-involves-nearly-30-companies/\n\n\nhttps://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-report-identifies-financial-and-privacy-risks-to-consumers-in-video-gaming-marketplaces/"

    "body": "Tax evasion and tax fraud through the abuse of charities is a serious and increasing risk in many countries, although its impact varies. The abuse of charities occurs when the sanctioned government status of a charitable organization is exploited either by the organization itself, by taxpayers and donors, or by third parties such as fraudsters who pose as charitable organizations or tax return preparers who falsify tax returns to defraud the government. \nRecent cases have highlighted how charity founders and executives have embezzled millions from their organizations, using donations meant for charitable purposes for personal expenses. Several countries provide tax relief to these organizations and their donors, which exposes these organizations to tax-related risks. For example, charitable contributions can significantly reduce taxable income, and the rules governing these deductions can be complex (Tax deductable donations). This complexity can be exploited for tax evasion and fraud.\nAdditionally, Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) can more easily conceal themselves behind the foundation structure, using it for tax evasion. Identifying UBOs is crucial for transparency and compliance with regulations, as it helps prevent financial crimes such as money laundering and tax evasion (UBO needs to be identified). The IRS has specific programs to identify and respond to abusive tax avoidance transactions involving tax-exempt organizations\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/charity-founder-and-ceo-charged-with-embezzling-millions-from-organization-and-tax-evasion https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/kyc/resources/insights/who-is-in-charge-here-brief-guide-to-ultimate-beneficial-owners-verification-legislation.html  https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-abusive-tax-avoidance-transactions"

Like their for-profit counterparts, NPOs are vulnerable to abuse by criminal and terrorist organizations. The abuse of charities is becoming increasingly organized and sophisticated, with the charity foundation structure sometimes being used to launder money or finance terrorism. The charity label provides an ideal cover, as people generally view charitable activities positively and are less likely to scrutinize them critically.\nTerrorist organizations exploit the high level of public trust in NPOs to further their objectives. They may infiltrate or misuse NPOs, taking advantage of their global presence, diverse activities, and the logistical capabilities they offer. This includes funds, materials, personnel, and public influence. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has highlighted the need for countries to implement risk-based measures to protect NPOs from terrorist financing abuse. NPOs operating in high-risk areas or those involved in service activities are particularly vulnerable. Terrorist groups may divert funds, abuse programs, or use NPOs for recruitment support. The complex nature of the sector and its global reach make it susceptible to exploitation by criminals and terrorist financiers.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/topics/financial-inclusion.html"

These risks can significantly impact their ability to serve their communities and achieve their missions. One of the primary environmental risks is climate change, which can lead to extreme weather events such as heatwaves, severe storms, droughts, and flooding. These events can disrupt the operations of NPOs, damage infrastructure, and increase the costs of providing services. NPOs often serve vulnerable populations who are disproportionately affected by environmental changes. For example, lower-income communities and marginalized groups may have less access to resources that can help them cope with the impacts of climate change (Aid for lower-income groups). This makes it even more critical for NPOs to address environmental risks proactively.\nIn addition to direct impacts, NPOs may also face regulatory and compliance challenges related to environmental sustainability. Governments and funding bodies are increasingly prioritizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, which means NPOs must align their operations with these standards to secure funding and support.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.victorinsurance.com/us/policyholders/victor-risk-advisory/us/non-profit/environmental-social-governance-risks-opportunities-non-profit-organizations.html  https://www.pbmares.com/external-environmental-risks-in-nonprofits-navigating-economic-political-and-natural-challenges/"

Charity fraud occurs when organizations solicit funds from the public under false pretenses or use the collected monies for purposes not intended by the donors. This type of fraud can include embezzlement and misappropriation of funds by executives, similar to the frauds that can plague business organizations. Charities may mislead donors about the percentage of contributions allocated to various business expenses, significantly overstating the amount that will go to the charitable cause. This deception can lead donors to believe that their contributions are making a more significant impact than they actually are.\nAdditionally, charitable organizations may engage in fraudulent activities by misrepresenting themselves or vaguely associating with well-known charities or governmental associations to obtain donations. An example of such deception is the case of the Police Survivors Fund, which was established in 1999 and disbanded by 2003 when its founder pleaded guilty to various fraud charges (Charity founder charged). More recent cases include the founders of the charity \"On Your Feet, Inc.\" who were sentenced to prison for using their non-profit to steal from donors and cheat on their taxes (On your feet), and the founder Aimee Bock of a children's nutrition nonprofit who was charged with embezzling millions from the organization (Aimee Bock).\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.gtfcu.org/greater-texas-articles/charity-fraud-understanding-identifying-and-preventing-it https://onlyearthlings.com/15-beloved-charities-caught-in-major-scandals/ https://www.acfe.com/fraud-magazine/all-issues/issue/article?s=2025-marapr-charity-fraud-dark-side-giving\n\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/charity-fraud\n\n\nhttps://www.acfe.com/fraud-magazine/all-issues/issue/article?s=2025-marapr-charity-fraud-dark-side-giving\n\n https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/charity-founder-and-ceo-charged-with-embezzling-millions-from-organization-and-tax-evasion  https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/charity-founders-sentenced-prison-using-non-profit-steal-donors-and-cheat-their-taxes"

This crime often involves schemes designed to complicate the documentation of legitimate trade transactions. Such actions may include moving illicit goods, falsifying documents, misrepresenting financial transactions, and under- or over-invoicing the value of goods.\nTrade mispricing practices play an increasingly important role, as anti-money laundering standards applied to other techniques for transferring illicit money across borders, particularly in the financial sector, have become more effective. Commodity trading involves complex processes and interconnected players. Under-reporting volumes or under-invoicing the value of resources sold allows the purchaser to resell them at an inflated price, with a share of the benefit potentially used to pay bribes.\nThis practice also enables trading companies to reduce the amount of customs duties owed to the exporting country. As trading operations are not subject to the same checks and controls as monetary flows, commodities can be easily used to circumvent anti-money laundering regulations and hide the origins of illicit funds. Proceeds of crime can be used to buy raw materials from traders who accept \"dirty money\" in exchange for commodities.

The economic importance of being able to trade flowers quickly stands in the way of thorough checks, while the transports are attractive for drug smuggling.\nThis is evident from a study commissioned by several municipalities, flower auction Royal FloraHolland, and the trade association of flower traders.\nHowever, it is suspected that the flower trade is mainly used for the transit of drugs from the Netherlands to the rest of Europe. Cocaine, for example, that enters the country via the port of Rotterdam is transported by road to other countries. Just last summer, 400 kilos of cocaine and speed were intercepted in a truck full of flowers. “The massive daily flower transports are attractive to criminals wanting to transport drugs,” the report warns. Every year, over 6 billion euros worth of flowers are exported from the Netherlands. There are shuttle services to almost every place in Europe, and cargo is rarely inspected within the European Union.\nThe researchers also warn of other forms of crime. Transports are also used to smuggle weapons, cigarettes, and fireworks (Special flowers). Because a lot of cash circulates in the flower sector, there is a risk that criminals use flower trading as a cover to launder their crime money. In addition, according to the report, there is fraud involving invoices, VAT rates, and consignment notes (Fin police report). Illegal labor practices are also common, with employment agencies involved in labor exploitation.\nAccording to the report, the flower auction itself plays an important role in tackling crime. A large part of the trade takes place via the auctions of Royal FloraHolland, which connects 4,000 growers and 2,500 traders. Many traders have a small business on the grounds of one of the auctions. It is often unclear who is behind these small businesses. Traders are allowed to sublet their space at the auction. Moreover, the sites in Aalsmeer, Naaldwijk, and Rijnsburg are hardly secured and freely accessible, unlike, for example, the port or the airport.

Forestry activities often occur in large, remote areas, far from public scrutiny and official oversight, making independent checks rare and enforcement capacity low. Forest resources are valuable, but timber volumes and quality are often imprecisely known. Local forestry officers have broad discretionary powers to measure, classify, and value forest products, often with minimal supervision. Government officers overseeing high-value products are frequently on low pay, creating strong incentives for corruption. Numerous regulations and permits, often poorly designed and open to interpretation, provide opportunities for corruption. Penalties for corruption are often minimal compared to the potential high returns, making it difficult to identify and punish corrupt officials.\nCorruption in the forestry sector can include illegal contracts, harvesting protected species, illegal logging, smuggling forest products, and manipulating trade to reduce tax liabilities."

These valued resources could include the provision of a service, legal permission to undertake some activity, or information of value stored in their IT facilities. IT service providers have the skills, confidence, and autonomy to make decisions about the provision of these resources. Therefore, they can be bribed to provide confidential information stored in their systems or to destroy information that may be incriminating to a certain party. They can also be bribed to use their skills to hack into people's private bank accounts, social media accounts, emails, etc.\nAbuse of IT corruption mainly occurs where financial interests are at stake, as well as in cases where IT abuse serves only the interests of a public official. Moreover, in order to operate IT services, an operational license is involved, which involves government officials, thereby leading to a bribery risk.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.deloitte.com/in/en/services.html"

Manufacturing processes contribute to a variety of environmental hazards, including atmospheric emissions of pollutants, soil contamination, greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the release of dust and noise pollution.\nFurthermore, the manufacturing industry involves a wide range of operational practices that carry unique safety risks for employees. Working with manufacturing machinery exposes workers to several hazards. Machines with gears, sprockets, pulleys, and rotating shafts present risks of entanglement, while areas where two hard surfaces move together pose a threat of crush injuries. Equipment with sharp edges or scissoring actions can cause cuts, punctures, or even severed limbs. Cables and hoses around machinery increase the risk of trip-and-fall accidents.. To mitigate these dangers, employers should install appropriate machine guards and ensure that machines are properly turned off during maintenance activities.\nBeyond occupational hazards, manufacturing processes also generate significant environmental risks through the production of air, liquid, and solid waste. Activities such as metalworking produce welding slags, dust, powders, and metal chips, which often contain various oxides.

Money laundering is essential for narcotics dealers to legitimize the proceeds of their illegal activities and integrate them into the financial system. Narcotics dealers employ various sophisticated techniques to launder money, such as using shell companies, trade-based money laundering, and cryptocurrencies. They also exploit financial institutions, real estate, and high-value goods to move and clean their money. The global nature of the narcotics trade means that money laundering operations often span multiple countries, making it challenging for authorities to track and intercept illicit financial flows.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.sanctionscanner.com/blog/leveraging-aml-procedures-to-combat-illicit-trafficking-in-narcotic-drugs-196"

This interaction can lead to corrupt practices, especially when National Oil Companies (NOCs) form joint ventures (JVs) with private companies, and government officials are appointed to the board of directors. Oil and gas companies often hire third parties, such as Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management (EPCM) firms, to manage their in-country operations. These third-party engagements can further increase the risk of fraud, bribery, and corruption. The complexity of oil and gas projects, which involve multiple components like exploration, drilling, facilities support, transport, and marketing, means that each component introduces another business partner, each posing potential corruption risks.\nIn the upstream stage, which involves the exploration of oil and gas, obtaining exploration licenses can be a significant source of corruption. Companies may bribe government officials to secure these licenses. In the downstream stage, transport infrastructure such as oil pipelines, ports, and terminals are often characterized as natural monopolies.

Some programs also lack proper identity verification or personal contact, and their broad acceptance makes them highly negotiable, further increasing the risk of money laundering.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://complyadvantage.com/insights/money-laundering-prepaid-cards/"

Additionally, accounting fraud, such as accounting or reporting manipulations, has become a significant concern in recent years. This type of fraud involves altering financial statements to present a misleading picture of an organization's financial health, which can have severe repercussions for public trust and financial stability. External frauds, on the other hand, often involve collusion between public officials and external parties, such as vendors or contractors, to defraud the government. These frauds can include bribery, corruption, and kickbacks, where public officials receive illicit payments in exchange for favorable treatment or contracts.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://risk.lexisnexis.com/insights-resources/infographic/2024-top-fraud-trends-and-threats-in-the-public-sector"

This vulnerability is exacerbated in large projects, where the stakes are higher, and the potential for bribing decision-makers involved in selling or buying real estate increases. Corruption in the real estate sector often involves offering bribes to government officials or other influential parties to secure favorable outcomes, such as obtaining permits, winning contracts, or influencing property valuations. This not only undermines fair competition but also leads to inflated project costs and substandard work, ultimately harming the public interest.\nFurthermore, nitrous oxide and ammonia emissions released during the construction of new houses have led to stringent nitrogen emission quotas, making it increasingly difficult to obtain permissions for new housing projects. This situation has made the industry more vulnerable to corruption, with increased attempts to bribe government officials to secure building permissions. The complexity and urgency of obtaining these permissions can lead to corrupt practices, where officials may be offered inducements to expedite or approve projects that would otherwise face regulatory hurdles. For instance, in the Netherlands, the nitrogen crisis has prevented the construction of thousands of homes, highlighting the impact of environmental regulations on housing development.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.transparency.org/en/press/new-index-reveals-alarming-opacity-and-money-laundering-vulnerabilities-global-real-estate"

This misrepresentation can involve over- and under-invoicing, multiple invoicing, over- and under-shipment, and false descriptions of goods, all of which provide a legal cover for the movement of illicit funds.\nOver-invoicing and under-invoicing are common techniques used in TBML. Over-invoicing involves inflating the value of goods on invoices to transfer larger sums of money, while under-invoicing involves declaring a lower value to evade taxes and duties. Multiple invoicing refers to issuing several invoices for the same shipment to justify multiple payments. False descriptions of goods can also be used to disguise the true nature of transactions, making it difficult for authorities to detect illegal activities.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.globaltrademag.com/from-fashion-textiles-to-money-laundering/"

This practice increases the likelihood of skin and respiratory exposure to toxic chemicals, posing serious health risks to farmers. The environmental impact of tobacco farming extends beyond chemical use. The industry is a major contributor to deforestation, as large areas of forest are cleared to make way for tobacco cultivation.
